  abstract =     { Abstract Economic losses from natural disasters have been
                  increasing in recent decades. This has been attributed mainly
                  to population and economic growth in disaster-prone areas.
                  Future natural disaster losses are expected to increase due to
                  a continued increase in economic exposure and climate change.
                  This highlights the importance of designing policies that can
                  mitigate the impacts of these disasters on the economy and
                  society. A rapidly expanding literature has estimated the
                  direct (e.g., property damage) and indirect (e.g., gross
                  domestic product growth, trade) economic impacts of natural
                  disasters. This article reviews this emerging literature. We
                  synthesize the main theoretical, computational, and empirical
                  methods used, summarize key findings on the economic impacts
                  of natural disasters, and discuss factors that have been found
                  to mitigate disaster impacts. We conclude by identifying
                  lessons for policymakers and outlining an agenda for future
                  research in this field. },

  abstract =     { Purpose: The paper aims to provide a general overview of the
                  impacts of climate change upon supply chains and to analyze
                  the implications of climate change for supply chain management
                  in terms of strategic and operational planning. A roadmap of
                  fruitful research approaches is also presented.
                  Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use of a general
                  review of the relevant literature and, based on a systematic
                  categorization of the findings, looks for useful insights
                  towards the issues of climate change and supply chain
                  management. A framework is drawn for systematically assessing
                  the impacts of climate change upon supply chains and their
                  management, while making suggestions for future research.
                  Findings and Originality/value: Supply chain networks run
                  physical, operational and reputational risks attributed to
                  climate change. Escalation in regulations, market forces and
                  stakeholders' pressures are paving the way for the
                  decarbonization of supply chains with obvious implications for
                  supply chain management. Supply chain managers should pay
                  special attention to the impacts of climate change on supply
                  chains and academics should further explore the
                  interrelationships between climate change and supply chain
                  design and operations. Research limitations/implications:
                  Additional qualitative research based on grounded theory is
                  suggested for validating and interconnecting the findings with
                  empirical data. Practical implications: The paper provides
                  several insights towards the issues of supply chain management
                  in view of climate change and may serve as an initial basis
                  for exploring future research directions by academics.
                  Practitioners, especially those drafting value-creating supply
                  chain agendas, may also find these insights useful for
                  improving their managerial practices. Originality/value: By
                  providing an original structured overview of the impacts of
                  climate change upon supply chain design and operations
                  management the paper substantiates the need for management
                  improvements and provides research directions that may prove
                  valuable to researchers. },

  abstract =     {Natural and anthropogenic disasters frequently affect both the
                  supply and demand side of an economy. A striking recent
                  example is the Covid-19 pandemic which has created severe
                  disruptions to economic output in most countries. These direct
                  shocks to supply and demand will propagate downstream and
                  upstream through production networks. Given the exogenous
                  shocks, we derive a lower bound on total shock propagation. We
                  find that even in this best case scenario network effects
                  substantially amplify the initial shocks. To obtain more
                  realistic model predictions, we study the propagation of
                  shocks bottom-up by imposing different rationing rules on
                  industries if they are not able to satisfy incoming demand.
                  Our results show that economic impacts depend strongly on the
                  emergence of input bottlenecks, making the rationing
                  assumption a key variable in predicting adverse economic
                  impacts. We further establish that the magnitude of initial
                  shocks and network density heavily influence model
                  predictions.},

                  and application of a computable general equilibrium model to
                  estimate the business interruption impacts of a Verdugo
                  scenario earthquake on the water system serving Los Angeles.
                  The model has been especially designed to incorporate
                  engineering and spatial aspects of this system in the context
                  of the regional economy to include resilience responses at
                  various water outage levels. The Verdugo earthquake scenario
                  and Monte Carlo simulations show that water outages in LA
                  County could result in business interruption losses of several
                  billion dollars without any resilience adjustment. However, a
                  reduction of these losses by more than 90\% is possible
                  through the application of several types of resilience on the
                  customer side, most prominently rescheduling production, in
                  addition to conservation, input substitution, and storage of
                  water. Allowing the price of water to rise to reflect its
                  scarcity would reduce the losses even further. },

The construction of this database, which allows for regional analysis at the level of so-called NUTS2 regions, is presented in detail for its methodology and applications. The tables merge data from WIOD (the 2013 release) with, regional economic accounts, and interregional trade estimates developed by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, complemented with survey-based regional input-output data for a limited number of countries. All used data are survey data and only non-behavioral assumptions have been made to estimate the EUREGIO dataset. These two general rules of data construction allow empirical analyses focused on impacts of changes in behavior (of economies, firms, policies) without endogenously having this behavior embedded already by construction. The tables are publicly available to the research community, from the Dutch government open data website. In this project, both a regional trade database, and production and consumption data of different actors in different regions, were used. The focus is thus intentionally on the regionalization of both trade and the regional use and supply of products by different economic actors. The paper is organized around the successive steps of the data construction: (1) adjustment of WIOD, (2) regional information, (3) Construction of tables, (4) conclusions on the usefulness of this type of regional IO tables with an overview of current applications of the EUREGIO database.},

                  displaced and more than 13 million need urgent humanitarian
                  assistance. Ukraine's economy is being devastated. Trauma
                  suffered by the population will have enduring consequences.
                  The war is triggering global ripple effects through multiple
                  channels, including commodity markets, trade, financial flows,
                  displaced people, and market confidence. In the surrounding
                  region, a large wave of refugees will put pressure on basic
                  services. The damage to Russia's economy will weigh on
                  remittance flows to many neighboring countries. Disruptions to
                  regional supply chains and financial networks, as well as
                  heightened investor risk perceptions, will weaken regional
                  growth},

  abstract =     {This essay surveys and summarizes recent research and reports
                  on the global economic impact of the COVID-19'new
                  coronavirus'. It argues that the major impact of the epidemic,
                  or alleged pandemic, is on the supply side of the global
                  economy - while remedies now considered and applied are
                  largely on the demand side. The global armory of tools against
                  supply side disruptions and shocks is very very limited. Under
                  reasonable scenarios, a global recession is likely.},

                  readable Python-based workflow definition language and a
                  powerful execution environment that scales from single-core
                  workstations to compute clusters without modifying the
                  workflow. It is the first system to support the use of
