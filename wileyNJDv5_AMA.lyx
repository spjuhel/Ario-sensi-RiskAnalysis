\begin_layout Abstract
Given the interconnectedness of economies and the prevalence of just-in-time
 production processes, even small interruptions to production caused by
 natural disasters can lead to great indirect economic impacts.
 A substantial body of literature on this subject exists, notably with the
 help of input-output analysis, CGE and agent-based models.
 However, such models rely on parameters and data which are often unobserved
 empirically or estimated with wide margins of uncertainty.
 The reliability of the models is therefore difficult to assess.
 Here, taking the example of the July 2021 floods in Germany, we analyze
 to what extent the results of the ARIO model are robust to input data and
 parameter choices.
 ARIO model is a widely used model in the literature, and has laid theoretical
 foundations for several other models.
 We conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying its key parameters, as well
 as the multi-regional input output tables which it uses as its main input
 data.
 For this, we develop a new resource-efficient Python implementation of
 the ARIO model, which enables a large number of simulations to be run.
 Our results show that the choice of the data source and parameters indeed
 heavily influences the outputs of the model.
 To ensure the robustness of their results, future studies on indirect economic
 impacts should incorporate several scenarios and employ data from various
 sources.

Natural disasters have long been recognized for their significant economic
 consequences.
 However, with the increasing frequency and severity of these events attributed
 to climate change, the issue has gained even greater prominence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lange-2020-projec-expos"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Of particular concern is the interconnectedness of economies and the prevalence
 of just-in-time production processes, which has raised alarms about the
 potential for even minor disruptions in supply chains to have profound
 indirect economic impacts

 Recent examples, such as the Suez Canal blockage

, highlight the vulnerability of global trade and the subsequent implications
 for economic stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although empirical studies have shed light on the global economic costs
 of natural disasters, precisely studying the characteristics of these costs
 remains challenging.
 One of the primary difficulties arises from the inherently indirect nature
 of the effects identified by models, making it problematic to isolate them
 in empirical data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "noth-2019-badly-hurt"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Economic outcomes influenced by specific events can become entangled with
 numerous other factors, further complicating the attribution of changes
 to specific causes, particularly on a global scale.
 Furthermore, the complex nature of indirect effects often involves multiple
 rounds of economic activity and feedback loops that are challenging to
 quantify

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these challenges, obtaining precise data on economic production
 for short-term analysis, below the yearly scale, can be arduous.
 Such data are often not readily available or may be subject to significant
 measurement error.
 Thus, there is an urgent need to enhance our understanding of the intricate
 economic effects of disasters and their impacts on supply chains, particularly
 within the context of climate change

 To address these issues, various modeling approaches have been proposed,
 including Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models

These models enable researchers to analyze the economic consequences of
 disasters in ways that would be difficult to achieve empirically, as well
 as enabling prospective analysis.
 They can be parameterized to reproduce existing empirical assessments of
 natural disasters, providing insights into associated impacts that may
 not be directly evaluated through empirical means.
 However, the reliability of the results generated by these models remains
 uncertain.
 Previous studies have demonstrated their sensitivity to the choice of parameter
s

 To our knowledge, no study exists on the sensitivity to the selection of
 multi-regional input-output tables (MRIOT) from different sources.
 This contrasts with the fact that such tables serve as crucial input economic
 data for these models and that there is an increasing availability of them

 We first carry out simulations over a large set of parameters, and then
 incrementally reduce the set by excluding the values that produce results
 at odds with observation, such as an economic crash, near-collapse or indirect
 impacts amounting to values that would have been registered, in light of
 what actually occurred.
 We then evaluate the remaining uncertainty.
 Our results show that the reliability of the outcomes of ARIO are crucially
 determined by the quality and quantity of data available on the empirical
 consequences of the natural disaster.

 This also calls for improvements in the collection of detailed economic

Our case study is the flood event that affected Germany in July 2021.
 The flooding event resulted from a large-scale weather situation that affected
 Western and Central Europe from 13 to 15 July 2021.
 This flood is considered to be the worst flooding disaster in Germany since
 the Hamburg storm surge of 1962.
 It primarily affected the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North
 Rhine-Westphalia.
 The disaster also resulted in significant damages in Bavaria and Saxony.
 The event claimed the lives of more than 180 people, making it one of the
 deadliest natural disaster since 1962

In this study, we use these figures as input to ARIO model to simulate the
 indirect economic damages of the floods.
 More precisely, we express the direct damages as a share of the 2021 Gross
 Value Added (GVA) of Germany or of each affected Lander (depending on the
 geograpic resolution of the MRIOT we use), and distribute these damages
 to the sectors of the different MRIOTs, using their contribution to the
 affected regions GDP as a proxy.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Later in the article, we compare the simulated indirect economic impact
 for different MRIOTs based on different years.
 As the German GVA is different for each year, to get comparable results,
 we suppose that the direct damages are constant relative to the size of
 the economy (i.e.
 we suppose that the direct damages amount to the same share of the GVA
 in all our simulations).

In ARIO, the economy is modelled as a set of economic sectors and a set
 of regions based on multi-regional input-output tables (MRIOT).
 In the following, we call an industry a specific (sector, region) couple.
 Each economic sector produces its generic product and draws inputs from
 an inventory.
 Each industry answers to a total demand consisting of a final demand (consistin
g of households consumption, government expenditures and capital formation)
 coming from all regions (i.e.
 both local demand and exports), an intermediate demand

 Additionally, total demand can also include an additional demand for the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model describes how exogenous shocks propagates across the economy at
 each time step (a day in this study).
 Such a shock is defined for a set of industries by the amount of production
 capacity lost and how the model recover from the shock either by:

 governed by a characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\textrm{recover}}$
\end_inset

Via the endogenous answer to a rebuilding demand.
 In this case, industries answer the remaining rebuilding demand at each
 step at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following a shock, the imbalance between production and demand is resolved
 by a proportional rationing scheme, which then leads clients of affected
 industries (both industries and households) to not receive the totality
 of their orders.
 Industries can buffer these unfilled orders with their inventories of inputs
 and increase their resupply demand, possibly shifting to other suppliers.
 Currently, households simply register the loss as final consumption not
 met.
 During the simulation, industries adjust their production and orders based
 on total demand.
 When total demand is higher than current production, industries can increase
 their output at a characteristic rate of 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{alpha}}}}$
\end_inset

 up to a maximum overproduction factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

.
 In ARIO, overproduction comes at no cost for the economic agents: it is
 limited by the fact that it is not an instantaneous process and that it
 cannot exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Production level is also constrained by the state of inventories.
 At a given step, inventory size of an input is defined as the number of
 days that an industry can sustain its current production level without
 receiving additional supplies.
 Therefore, inventory goals are set relative to the initial inventory values
 as well as the current production capacity.

 For example, at a value of 0.9, production would only be reduced when the
 inventory of an inputs falls below 90% of the goal.

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is close to 1, shortages and bottlenecks are more likely to appear, or
 to appear sooner.
 In that sense, inventories allow ARIO to be more flexible than pure IO
 models, but also create the possibility of a drop in production output
 due to shortages.

We study ARIO's sensitivity to both the economic data used as input (the
 MRIOTs) — as multiple readily available sources exist, and to the parameters
 of the model.
 To do this, we first run simulations of the indirect cost of German 2021
 floods using 3 different MRIOTs (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec41"

\end_inset

), and a wide range of values for the parameters (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec42"

\end_inset

).
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 presents the outputs of the model that we analyze.
 To get meaningful estimates of the uncertainty of the model, we then reduce
 the set of parameter values by excluding the values that produce results
 at odds with empirical observations (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 EUREGIO and EORA26 (see table

 We choose these three MRIOTs for their specificities.
 EXIOBASE 3, for instance, has a very precise typologies of sectors, whereas
 EORA26 contains data for almost all countries.
 EUREGIO, for its part, has a sub-national geographic resolution for the
 EU.
 These characteristics are summarized in Table mriot-summary.
 In addition, we compare results using both year 2000 and 2010 (which is
 the largest gap in time common to all three MRIOTs), to assess how this
 influence the results.

\begin_layout Standard
This parameter determines how an industry can ramp up its production when
 there is a higher demand than the current production level.
 It is a measure of the time it takes for the industry to respond to the
 scarcity of goods.
 The magnitude of this parameter is linked to a scarcity index, meaning
 that as the gap between production and demand widens, the industry accelerates
 its overproduction at a faster pace (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, which implies that it takes approximately one year for the industry to
 reach maximum overproduction.
 Previous studies used a value of half a year

\end_layout

If

 on five different values: 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 0.9 and 1 and shows the model to be

 As 0.5 and 0.7 values show no forward propagation of the initial shock, we
 assume evaluating for a lower value is not necessary.
 Moreover, in the same study, he suggests that for the case of a region
 being affected in a large economy,

 Hence, in our analysis, we investigate the effects of the following

), and to our knowledge, no study exists that compares both scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, natural disasters can affect production capacity only temporarily
 without requiring productive capital to be rebuilt.
 As well, the need for rebuilding, when required, may not be strictly equivalent
 to the direct damages, as some destroyed elements may not be reconstructed.
 Our two scenarios provide insights on how considering a rebuilding demand
 or not affect results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both cases, we also evaluate the sensitivity to the temporal dimension
 of the recovery process.
 We consider multiple characteristic periods
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the recovery case, a characteristic period of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{recover}$

 days means that productive capital is recovered in approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{recover}$

 days (depending on the recovery curve).
 For the rebuilding case, it means that 
\begin_inset Formula ${1}/{\tau_{rebuilding}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining rebuilding demand is ordered at each step.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ranging from three months to two years.
 For the recovery case (no rebuilding demand) we also consider the sensitivity
 to the shape of the recovery curve (linear or S-shaped).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we do not make any assumptions about the likelihood or validity
 of the considered scenarios for the chosen case study.
 Rather, this study serves as a theoretical exploration of the sensitivity
 of the economic model to different recovery and rebuilding scenarios.

Our analysis primarily focuses on the region directly affected by the natural

 To facilitate comparison with existing literature, we express indirect
 damages as a share of the direct damages.
 Additionally, when comparing the impacts across different sectors, we express
 the indirect damages as a share of the initial production level.
 This approach allows us to gauge the relative severity of indirect damages
 within each sector.

We remind here that these values have not been validated using empirical
 data, thus cannot be used to validate results in a strict sense.
 They do agree, however, that indirect losses are of a similar magnitude
 as direct losses.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that studies utilizing the ARIO model indicate that indirect losses
 exhibit a non-linear relationship with direct losses.
 Therefore, results that do not fall in the same order of magnitude as the
 direct damages should not automatically be deemed unrealistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Especially, depending on the time windows considered after the event, indirect
 losses can vary importantly as recovery/rebuilding dynamics can last for
 more than one year after the event, and short-term losses (a few months
 after the event) may be compensated or on the contrary aggravated in the
 medium term (up to two year after the event).
 Notably, several studies show that depending on the amount of direct damage,
 the choice of parameters (in relevant cases) and the amount of time after
 the event considered, indirect losses can be negative (i.e., net production
 gains)

In the following, we express indirect losses relative to the direct damages
 or relative to yearly production when comparing impacts on the sector level.
 Note that, as the net change can be positive (production gains compared
 to baseline), we will use positive values to designate production gains,
 and negative values for losses.

When we look at simulations where indirect losses are more than five times
 the direct losses, (corresponding to the previously defined criterion),
 we find that such indirect losses only appear when the following are met:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rebuilding demand is considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rebuilding time is below a year (six and three month).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least equal to 0.95
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Overproduction pace is low enough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we observe that for all parameter sets where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is strictly below 1, EORA26 is the only MRIOT for which indirect losses
 exceed our criterion.
 In order to get comparable sets of parameters for all MRIOTs we remove:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where rebuilding time is three months and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least 0.97.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where rebuilding time is six months, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least 0.97 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

 is strictly greater than 90 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is 0.95, rebuilding time is three months and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

 is strictly greater than 90 days.

, we find a mix of positive and negative impacts across all MRIOTs.
 These outcomes are predominantly driven by the pace of the rebuilding process.
 Notably, excessively rapid path (3 months) tends to lead to shortages,
 thereby driving the occurrence of important negative impacts.
 On the other hand, prolonged rebuilding paths (2 years) induce negative
 impacts from the prolonged reduced production and although less frequent,
 shortages can also manifest in this scenario.
 Conversely, rebuilding paths that do not result in shortages, or only lead
 to marginal shortages, generate production gains.
 These gains are driven by the demand generated through the rebuilding process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also observe that the variation in results between different MRIOTs becomes
 more pronounced for sets of parameters which lead to important negative
 indirect impacts.
 This indicates a higher sensitivity to both the chosen parameters and the
 specific MRIOT employed for pessimistic assumptions on the parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the sensitivity to parameters and
 MRIOTs increases as indirect losses escalate.
 This observation aligns with the non-linear relationship between indirect
 losses and direct losses, indicating that the magnitude of the indirect
 impacts amplifies the sensitivity of the results.

 In the absence of considering rebuilding demand, all sectors experience
 a relatively uniform decline of approximately -0.1% in their yearly production.
 The spread of results across sectors remains relatively low in this scenario.
 However, when taking into account the rebuilding demand, the construction
 sector exhibits a significant range of changes spanning from losses surpassing
 -0.5% to gains exceeding +1.5% of yearly production.
\end_layout

For other sectors, the results primarily reflect losses, with variations
 ranging from -1.5% to -1% in declines, and gains of less than +0.1%.
 We find that results obtained from the EXIOBASE3 MRIOT demonstrate a narrower
 range, limited to losses of -0.5% and gains of +0.1%.

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Conversely, simulations considering rebuilding demand show a higher incidence
 of shortages, outlier results are all associated with this case.
 The occurrence and extent of shortages is particularly pronounced when
 a combination of factors is present: a 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 value above 0.8, a short rebuilding time, and (to a lesser extent) a slower
 pace of overproduction.
 Moreover, slight differences in parameter sets fulfilling this combination
 of factors lead to higher relative deviations in the results than for the
 rest of the parameter sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the different MRIOTs, EXIOBASE 3 demonstrates greater resilience to
 shortages.
 Very few simulations within this framework exhibit shortages, and there
 are no outlier results associated with this MRIOT.
 In contrast, the EORA26 and EUREGIO MRIOTs exhibit a higher susceptibility
 to shortages.

\begin_layout Standard
Parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 value does not significantly influence the recovery case.
 This is expected since there are no significant shortages in this scenario.
 Moreover, lower values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 have minimal impact on the results, whereas higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 considerably increase result variability and shift them towards losses.
 Specifically, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is strictly below 0.90, the results range between -60% and +50% of the direct
 damages, while a 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 value of 0.90 extends the range to -300% and +50%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

, which denotes the pace of overproduction, it has limited influence in
 the recovery case.
 Lower values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

, indicating faster overproduction, lead to lower maximum losses, ranging
 from -50% of the direct damages for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=530$
\end_inset

 to -30% for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=90$
\end_inset

.
 In the rebuilding case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

 has little effect on the spread of results but shifts them towards gains
 as its value decreases.
 For example, gains do not exceed +10% of the direct damages for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=530$
\end_inset

, but increase up to +35% for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=90$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of the recovery/rebuilding time also plays a role.
 In the recovery case, faster recovery times result in lower maximum losses,
 ranging from -50% of the direct damages for a two-year recovery time to
 -20% for a three-month recovery time.
 In the rebuilding case, the effect varies depending on the MRIOT considered.
 For EXIOBASE 3, shorter rebuilding times shift the results towards gains,
 with the range changing from -50% to +20% for the two-year scenario to
 -5% to +35% for the three-month scenario.
 Similar shifts towards gains can be observed for EORA26 and EUREGIO, but
 as the rebuilding time decreases, the spread of results increases, particularly
 for EORA26.

When examining other regions the analysis reveals the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the recovery case, overall, gains are observed.
 However, these gains do not exceed +3% of the direct damages.
 In rare instances where indirect impacts result in losses, they represent
 less than -0.5% of the direct damages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the rebuilding case, most outcomes are also gain, and tend to be significantl
y higher than in the recovery case.
 For instance, these gains can reach up to +25% of the direct damages in
 the 
\family typewriter
ROW
\family default
 region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although less simulation lead to losses for not directly affected regions,
 there are still several outliers ranging which show significant losses.
 For instance in the 
\family typewriter
ROW
\family default
 region, more than 10 simulations lead to losses higher than -50%, half
 of them higher than -100%.
 Note here, that 
\family typewriter
ROW
\family default
 region aggregates the losses of a large number of regions.
 When comparing to the actual size of the 
\family typewriter
ROW
\family default
 economy, the highest indirect damages represent less than -0.2% of yearly
 production.
 For France (
\family typewriter
FRA
\family default
), highest indirect impacts are less than -0.3% of yearly production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that when using the EXIOBASE3 MRIOT, losses are not observed
 in the rebuilding case except for very rare cases in 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analyzing the sector-level impacts, the majority of the gains are driven
 by the Manufacturing sector.
 On the other hand, no significant patterns emerge in terms of losses, except
 that the Construction and Other sectors exhibit noticeably fewer losses
 compared to the rest of the sectors.

The rebuilding path is a crucial factor that significantly influences the
 outcomes.
 This highlights the importance of its precise modelling and greater care

Our results also suggest that historic values of

 and alpha tau from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 can be generally applicable as no results using these values were outliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results show that, the results are heavily dependent on assumptions
 about recovery and the rigidity of constraints on the actors.
 This aligns with existing studies that have shown both positive and negative
 indirect impacts following a shock.
 Interestingly, the ARIO model's dynamics can both lead to negative and
 positive impacts (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

creative destruction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hypothesis).
 While this provides versatility in representing economic dynamics, it highlight
s the importance of carefully selecting parameters and interpreting the
 results due to the wide range of possible outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering these findings, we suggest that the ARIO model is best used
 when examining different recovery story-lines from a shock defined by different
 sets of parameters.
 For instance, comparing results obtained assuming an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimal recovery path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

struggling recovery path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could offer valuable insights at local and global levels, providing both
 optimistic and pessimistic estimates of aggregated losses from extreme
 events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, integrating detailed empirical data on indirect losses following
 a shock can further refine and reduce the uncertainty of the ARIO model's
 results by calibrating better each parameter.
 This approach would contribute to enhancing the accuracy and reliability
 of the model's outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our analysis did not include parameters related to inventories, such as
 size and resupply time and sectoral (or even regional) heterogeneity, due
 to the complexity it would introduce, especially on a per-sector and per-MRIOT
 basis.
 However, this paper and the BoARIO package, both provide a starting point
 toward such an analysis.
\end_layout

Further research steps should also involve analyzing the effects of other
 events using our methodology and conducting an inter-comparison with other
 models to enhance the robustness and consistency of our findings.

\begin_layout Standard
The economy is modelled as a set of economic sectors and a set of regions.
 In the following, we call an industry a specific (sector, region) couple.
 Each economic sector produces its generic product and draws inputs from
 an inventory.
 Each industry answers to a total demand consisting of a final demand (household
 consumption, public spending and private investments) coming from all regions
 (i.e.
 both local demand and exports), intermediate demand (inventory resupply).
 An initial equilibrium state of the economy is built based on multi-regional
 input-output tables (MRIOT).
 Apart from parameters specific to the MRIOT region-sector typology, BoARIO
 handles any MRIOT in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple kinds of shocks can be implemented:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the production capacity directly (one or multiple industries are arbitrarily
 forced to produce less)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the productive capital (one or multiple industries arbitrarily lose some
 part of their factors of production and are thus forced to both produce
 less and to build back their capital stock).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the households (households of affected regions lose some part of their
 goods and seek to get them back).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model then describes how exogenous shocks propagates across the economy
 at each time step (a day in the present study
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our implementation actually allows for any time granularity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

): the imbalance between production and demand is resolved by a proportional
 rationing scheme, which then leads some industries and households to not
 receive the totality of their orders.
 Industries can buffer these unfilled orders with their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inventories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of input and increase or shift their resupply demand.
 Currently, households simply register the loss as final consumption not
 met and do not postpone their demand.
 During the simulation, industries adjust their production and orders based
 on both demand and their inventories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct economic impact consists in the valuation of the initial exogenous
 shock, while total economic impact includes also indirect costs consequent
 to the propagation.
 Total economic impact can be measured in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Final demand not met, i.e.
 goods that households could not buy due to rationing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Relative production change, i.e.
 diminished or increased production of industries relative to their initial
 production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we focus on the second measure.

\begin_layout Standard
The initial state refers to an economic equilibrium before any exogenous
 shocks.
 Initial values for intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t=0)$
\end_inset

, final consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(t=0)$
\end_inset

 and production 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t=0)$
\end_inset

 are derived from the MRIOT.
 Inventories 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(t)$
\end_inset

 are stocks of inputs an industry can draw into (see below for a detailed
 description of inventories) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(t=0)$
\end_inset

 are initialized using the initial intermediate orders: by default, it is
 assumed that every industry has a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\textrm{input}}$
\end_inset

 of days of inputs ahead in their stocks.

Inventories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ARIO, economic sectors do not use inputs from other sectors directly,
 but draw inputs from inventories, that can then be re-supplied with intermediat
e orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

.
 An industry's inventory is a vector that specifies how much of each product
 this industry has in stock.
 Each sector needs intermediate inputs in proportions given by the MRIOT
 at the initial state.
 Industries draw inputs from their inventories to try to produce at the
 optimal production level 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 However, these inventories cannot be emptied: actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 can thus be set lower than optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

 to be sure that inventories are above a certain threshold (see Production
 for more details).
 Inventories have been implemented into ARIO to give a more realistic account
 of supply chain shocks, which can be mitigated by input stocks.
 The current state of an inventory for a definite input is expressed as
 the number of time steps a sector can produce with said input at current
 production level.
\end_layout

Direct shocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "app1.1.2 shock"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct shocks are exogenous and can occur at any time step t.
 Conceptually, these shocks are the direct economic consequences of the
 events we are modelling.
 They can either be (i) direct production capacity losses or (ii) capital
 destruction.
 Capital is the only factor of production, so that in any industry 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 capital destruction turns into 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 production loss, as long as capital is not restored.
 There are two ways to model capital rebuilding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Recovery Productive capital recovers from a purely exogenous function and
 at no cost for the economic agents: capital stock in a directly impacted
 industry goes back to its original level over time, following a chosen
 recovery curve, without any need for production sparing for rebuilding.
 This scenario can model the situation where capital is not actually destroyed
 but less available for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Rebuilding Productive capital is recovered through an endogenous rebuilding
 demand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 which consists of new orders directed to sectors that usually provide capital
 stock: construction, transport equipment, manufacturing, etc.
 This additional demand leads to a reduction of actual production being
 allocated
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a reduction also happens in the Recovery case but to a lesser extent,
 as it only comes from the production reduction caused by the event
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to final demand 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(t)$
\end_inset

 or intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production module computes actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 for each industry at the current time step with the following process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It computes production capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

, which is production in the initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t=0)$
\end_inset

 less production capacity reduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It defines optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

 as the minimum between production capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

 and total demand 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)+Y(t)+\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 : the model is demand-driven, and industries cannot produce more than total
 demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, the actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 is computed from 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

, taking into account inventories constraints.
 More precisely, an industry can produce 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 only if it has more than a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 of the required inputs of each type to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\textrm{input}}$
\end_inset

 time steps in a row, in order to model producers' or cautious anticipatory
 behavior.
 In order to satisfy this constraint, if the inventory for an input is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 below the aforementioned threshold, actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 is reduced by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 compared to optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 This constraint must be satisfied for each type of input (i.e.
 sectors) involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lastly, inputs required for production are then drawn from their respective
 inventories.

Orders and demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "app1.1.2 orders"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The order/demand module computes the various demands.
 Total demand consists of final demand 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(t)$
\end_inset

, intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

 and rebuilding demand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Final demand 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(t)$
\end_inset

 for each region is exogenous and set by the MRIOT.
 Currently, it stays fixed during the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

 are decided based on inventories and consists of two parts: the first part
 is the amount of inputs used to produce during the current step, while
 the second is a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{inv}}}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining gap with inventory goal.
 Inventory goals are defined as the inventories needed to produce at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case capital rebuilding has been set as endogenous, only a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining rebuilding demand is ordered at each step, so that rebuilding
 is not instantaneous but takes a characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}$
\end_inset

.
 Rebuilding demand is used to build back capital stocks and thus restores
 production capacities to their pre-shock levels.
 If capital rebuilding is exogenous, there is no rebuilding demand.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution module allocates the actual production towards the various
 demands.
 Distribution follows a proportional rationing scheme: if total demand cannot
 be met, intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

, final demand 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(t)$
\end_inset

 and rebuilding demand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 receive actual production according to their share of total demand.

Overproduction

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ARIO, industries can temporarily increase their production capacity from
 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\times x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

 when they cannot meet total demand.
 It is a gradual process: when needed, the overproduction factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 can switch from a base value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{b}$
\end_inset

 (most often 1) up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

 with an exogenous characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 The evolution of also depends on a scarcity index, defined as unmet demand
 divided by total demand: it is faster the higher the scarcity index is.
 In the current state of development of BoARIO, overproduction comes at
 no cost for the economic agents: it is limited by the fact that it is not
 an instantaneous process and that it cannot exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

 IO model.
 As shortages start to appear, demand is still distributed among suppliers
 in the same proportions as before the shock.
 However, as unmet demand grows, suppliers that have not been affected by
 direct impacts (on capital or production) can overproduce and catch demand
 from new buyers.
 Buyers will then marginally shift their orders to producers that can overproduc
e.

a)
\end_layout

\end_inset

When the industry does not have to answer a rebuilding demand, or in the
 recovery case, and no shortage happens (either because the shock is too
 small or the parameters not too constraining).
 The model suffers a loss of production for the duration of the event and
 then slowly regains its production output via the recovery as well as the
 overproduction mechanism.
 A small overshoot to refill possible remaining gaps in inventories can
 be seen before initial equilibrium is found again.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Argument item:1

\begin_layout Plain Layout
b)
\end_layout

\end_inset

If a shortage happens, it slows down the return of production level to its
 initial amount, possibly extending the recovery period.
 It may also slightly increase the overshoot in production as inventory
 gaps are increased by the longer recovery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Argument item:1
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
c)
\end_layout

\end_inset

When the industry answers a rebuilding demand, but no shortage happens,
 production rises more sharply due to the increased scarcity created by
 the rebuilding demand.
 Production also continues to increase as long as total demand is not met,
 and starts decreasing when it is met and remaining rebuilding demand and
 inventory gaps are answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Argument item:1
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
d)
\end_layout

\end_inset

If a shortage happens, production reduces to match its inventories.
 As long as total demand remains higher than production for the input(s)
 responsible for the shortage, the inventory gap continues to increase and
 production to decrease.
 This stops when production is low enough and received orders are high enough
 so that the gap starts decreasing.
 Production then increases back as in the last phase of c), but sharply
 due to the increased orders to refill inventories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actual responses can of course be more complex, as interrelations between
 industries create feedbacks.
 As such, shortages can occur earlier or later, at several different times,
 and decrease production to a greater extent.

 calibrate, and therefore the transparency of modeled impacts.
 Considering both the conceptual model or its implementation, several hypotheses
