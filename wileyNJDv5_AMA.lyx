\begin_layout Abstract
Given the interconnectedness of economies and the prevalence of just-in-time
 production processes, even small interruptions to production caused by
 natural disasters can lead to great indirect economic impacts.
 A substantial body of literature on this subject exists, notably with the
 help of input-output analysis, CGE and agent-based models.
 However, such models rely on parameters and data which are often unobserved
 empirically or estimated with wide margins of uncertainty.
 The reliability of the models is therefore difficult to assess.
 Here, taking the example of the July 2021 floods in Germany, we analyze
 to what extent the results of the ARIO model are robust to input data and
 parameter choices.
 ARIO model is a widely used model in the literature, and has laid theoretical
 foundations for several other models.
 We conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying its key parameters, as well
 as the multi-regional input output tables which it uses as its main input
 data.
 For this, we develop a new resource-efficient Python implementation of
 the ARIO model, which enables a large number of simulations to be run.
 Our results show that the choice of the data source and parameters indeed
 heavily influences the outputs of the model.
 To ensure the robustness of their results, future studies on indirect economic
 impacts should incorporate several scenarios and employ data from various
 sources.

Natural disasters have long been recognized for their significant economic
 consequences.
 However, with the increasing frequency and severity of these events attributed
 to climate change, the issue has gained even greater prominence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lange-2020-projec-expos"

\end_inset

.
 Of particular concern is the interconnectedness of economies and the prevalence
 of just-in-time production processes, which has raised alarms about the
 potential for even minor disruptions in supply chains to have profound
 indirect economic impacts

 Recent examples, such as the Suez Canal blockage

, highlight the vulnerability of global trade and the subsequent implications
 for economic stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although empirical studies have shed light on the global economic costs
 of natural disasters, precisely studying the characteristics of these costs
 remains challenging.
 One of the primary difficulties arises from the inherently indirect nature
 of the effects identified by models, making it problematic to isolate them
 in empirical data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "noth-2019-badly-hurt"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Economic outcomes influenced by specific events can become entangled with
 numerous other factors, further complicating the attribution of changes
 to specific causes, particularly on a global scale.
 Furthermore, the complex nature of indirect effects often involves multiple
 rounds of economic activity and feedback loops that are challenging to
 quantify

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these challenges, obtaining precise data on economic production
 for short-term analysis, below the yearly scale, can be arduous.
 Such data are often not readily available or may be subject to significant
 measurement error.
 Thus, there is an urgent need to enhance our understanding of the intricate
 economic effects of disasters and their impacts on supply chains, particularly
 within the context of climate change

 To address these issues, various modeling approaches have been proposed,
 including Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models

These models enable researchers to analyze the economic consequences of
 disasters in ways that would be difficult to achieve empirically, as well
 as enabling prospective analysis.
 They can be parameterized to reproduce existing empirical assessments of
 natural disasters, providing insights into associated impacts that may
 not be directly evaluated through empirical means.
 However, the reliability of the results generated by these models remains
 uncertain.
 Previous studies have demonstrated their sensitivity to the choice of parameter

 To our knowledge, no study exists on the sensitivity to the selection of
 multi-regional input-output tables (MRIOT) from different sources.
 This contrasts with the fact that such tables serve as crucial input economic

 We first carry out simulations over a large set of parameters, and then
 incrementally reduce the set by excluding the values that produce results
 at odds with observation, such as an economic crash, near-collapse or indirect
 impacts amounting to values that would have been registered, in light of
 what actually occurred.
 We then evaluate the remaining uncertainty.
 Our results show that the reliability of the outcomes of ARIO are crucially
 determined by the quality and quantity of data available on the empirical
 consequences of the natural disaster.

Our case study is the flood event that affected Germany in July 2021.
 The flooding event resulted from a large-scale weather situation that affected
 Western and Central Europe from 13 to 15 July 2021.
 This flood is considered to be the worst flooding disaster in Germany since
 the Hamburg storm surge of 1962.
 It primarily affected the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North
 Rhine-Westphalia.
 The disaster also resulted in significant damages in Bavaria and Saxony.
 The event claimed the lives of more than 180 people, making it one of the
 deadliest natural disaster since 1962

In this study, we use these figures as input to ARIO model to simulate the
 indirect economic damages of the floods.
 More precisely, we express the direct damages as a share of the 2021 Gross
 Value Added (GVA) of Germany or of each affected Lander (depending on the
 geograpic resolution of the MRIOT we use), and distribute these damages
 to the sectors of the different MRIOTs, using their contribution to the
 affected regions GDP as a proxy.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Later in the article, we compare the simulated indirect economic impact
 for different MRIOTs based on different years.
 As the German GVA is different for each year, to get comparable results,
 we suppose that the direct damages are constant relative to the size of
 the economy (i.e.
 we suppose that the direct damages amount to the same share of the GVA
 in all our simulations).

In ARIO, the economy is modelled as a set of economic sectors and a set
 of regions based on multi-regional input-output tables (MRIOT).
 In the following, we call an industry a specific (sector, region) couple.
 Each economic sector produces its generic product and draws inputs from
 an inventory.
 Each industry answers to a total demand consisting of a final demand (consistin
g of households consumption, government expenditures and capital formation)
 coming from all regions (i.e.
 both local demand and exports), an intermediate demand

 (trade between firms represented by inventory resupply).
 Additionally, total demand can also include an additional demand for the
 rebuilding process (see Sec.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model describes how exogenous shocks propagates across the economy at
 each time step (a day in this study).
 Such a shock is defined for a set of industries by the amount of production
 capacity lost and how the model recover from the shock either by:
\end_layout

 governed by a characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\textrm{recover}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Via the endogenous answer to a rebuilding demand.
 In this case, industries answer the remaining rebuilding demand at each
 step at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following a shock, the imbalance between production and demand is resolved
 by a proportional rationing scheme, which then leads clients of affected
 industries (both industries and households) to not receive the totality
 of their orders.
 Industries can buffer these unfilled orders with their inventories of inputs
 and increase their resupply demand, possibly shifting to other suppliers.
 Currently, households simply register the loss as final consumption not
 met.
 During the simulation, industries adjust their production and orders based
 on total demand.
 When total demand is higher than current production, industries can increase
 their output at a characteristic rate of 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{alpha}}}}$
\end_inset

 up to a maximum overproduction factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

.
 In ARIO, overproduction comes at no cost for the economic agents: it is
 limited by the fact that it is not an instantaneous process and that it
 cannot exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{max}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Production level is also constrained by the state of inventories.
 At a given step, inventory size of an input is defined as the number of
 days that an industry can sustain its current production level without
 receiving additional supplies.
 Therefore, inventory goals are set relative to the initial inventory values
 as well as the current production capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably, if the inventory of an input appears insufficient to maintain the
 current production level for a goal duration, an industry will enter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\shape italic

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: it will reduce its production output so that its current inventory becomes
 sufficient to supply production for the given duration.
 Parameter

\end_inset

, which may range from 0 to 1, governs how industries treat their inventories
 when they are below objective.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shortage regime
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example, at a value of 0.9, production would only be reduced when the
 inventory of an inputs falls below 90% of the goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is close to 1, shortages and bottlenecks are more likely to appear, or
 to appear sooner.
 In that sense, inventories allow ARIO to be more flexible than pure IO
 models, but also create the possibility of a drop in production output
 due to shortages.

 the set of parameter values by excluding the values that produce results
 at odds with empirical observations (Section

Input-Output tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use three different MRIOT sources for this study, namely EXIOBASE 3,
 EUREGIO and EORA26 (see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:mriot"

\end_inset

).
 We choose these three MRIOTs for their specificities.
 EXIOBASE 3, for instance, has a very precise typologies of sectors, whereas
 EORA26 contains data for almost all countries.
 EUREGIO, for its part, has a sub-national geographic resolution for the
 EU.
 These characteristics are summarized in Table mriot-summary.
 In addition, we compare results using both year 2000 and 2010 (which is
 the largest gap in time common to all three MRIOTs), to assess how this
 influence the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the technical coefficients matrix of these MRIOTs, which
 can be considered as a normalized representation of economic structure,
 is presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app4"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The figures show substantial variations in the relative differences between
 technical coefficients across the different MRIOTs, spanning a range of
 10 to 1000.
 While part of the variations can be attributed to dissimilarities in the
 composition of the aggregated sectors for the different MRIOTs (notably
 the "Other" sector), there are variations exceeding a factor of 10, even
 among sectors that are expected to be closely aligned across MRIOTS, such
 as the "Construction" and "Agriculture and other" sectors.
 Discrepancies between two consecutive years within the same MRIO framework
 are shown for EXIOBASE3.
 As anticipated, variations in technical coefficients occur less frequently
 when comparing two years of the same MRIO, especially when looking the
 domestic trade links.
 However, some international trade connections shift by factors ranging
 from 5 to 1000, notably the "Agriculture and other" input for "Construction"
 and "Energy and Utilities and "Mining" sectors.
 These findings underscore the nontrivial nature of MRIOT selection.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inventory sizes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We set the initial inventory size for all inputs to 90 days of pre-disaster
 economic activity, and the characteristic time for inventory resupply (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec32"

\end_inset

) to 60 days same as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallegatte13_model_role_inven_heter_asses"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We chose not to vary these parameters: a sensitivity analysis considering
 identical values for all sector already exists in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallegatte13_model_role_inven_heter_asses"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, hence further analysis would require to define per sector values which
 was not computationally feasible in the scope of this study.
 The extent of simulations required to comprehensively explore the influence
 of these inventory parameters being too great for the scope of the present
 study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also define a list of sectors which we consider non-constraining inputs
 in the short term (i.e.
 a shortage of these inputs has no effect on production capacity) :

\begin_layout Standard
This parameter determines how an industry can ramp up its production when
 there is a higher demand than the current production level.
 It is a measure of the time it takes for the industry to respond to the
 scarcity of goods.
 The magnitude of this parameter is linked to a scarcity index, meaning
 that as the gap between production and demand widens, the industry accelerates
 its overproduction at a faster pace (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "app1.1.2 overprod"

, which implies that it takes approximately one year for the industry to
 reach maximum overproduction.
 Previous studies used a value of half a year

 As 0.5 and 0.7 values show no forward propagation of the initial shock, we
 assume evaluating for a lower value is not necessary.
 Moreover, in the same study, he suggests that for the case of a region

We compare these two cases, as both exist in the literature (e.g.,

), and to our knowledge, no study exists that compares both scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, natural disasters can affect production capacity only temporarily
 without requiring productive capital to be rebuilt.
 As well, the need for rebuilding, when required, may not be strictly equivalent
 to the direct damages, as some destroyed elements may not be reconstructed.
 Our two scenarios provide insights on how considering a rebuilding demand
 or not affect results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both cases, we also evaluate the sensitivity to the temporal dimension
 of the recovery process.
 We consider multiple characteristic periods
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the recovery case, a characteristic period of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{recover}$
\end_inset

 days means that productive capital is recovered in approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{recover}$
\end_inset

 days (depending on the recovery curve).
 For the rebuilding case, it means that 
\begin_inset Formula ${1}/{\tau_{rebuilding}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining rebuilding demand is ordered at each step.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ranging from three months to two years.
 For the recovery case (no rebuilding demand) we also consider the sensitivity
 to the shape of the recovery curve (linear or S-shaped).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we do not make any assumptions about the likelihood or validity
 of the considered scenarios for the chosen case study.
 Rather, this study serves as a theoretical exploration of the sensitivity
 of the economic model to different recovery and rebuilding scenarios.

Our analysis primarily focuses on the region directly affected by the natural
 disaster, Germany.
 To facilitate comparison with existing literature, we express indirect
 damages as a share of the direct damages.
 Additionally, when comparing the impacts across different sectors, we express
 the indirect damages as a share of the initial production level.
 This approach allows us to gauge the relative severity of indirect damages
 within each sector.

 As our objective is to estimate the reliability of ARIO results in a situation

 These studies use either ARIO or a different methodology.
 Our criterion for considering indirect losses to be unrealistic is that
 they exceed direct damages by more than 500%, corresponding to the highest

\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that studies utilizing the ARIO model indicate that indirect losses
 exhibit a non-linear relationship with direct losses.
 Therefore, results that do not fall in the same order of magnitude as the
 direct damages should not automatically be deemed unrealistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Especially, depending on the time windows considered after the event, indirect
 losses can vary importantly as recovery/rebuilding dynamics can last for
 more than one year after the event, and short-term losses (a few months
 after the event) may be compensated or on the contrary aggravated in the
 medium term (up to two year after the event).
 Notably, several studies show that depending on the amount of direct damage,
 the choice of parameters (in relevant cases) and the amount of time after
 the event considered, indirect losses can be negative (i.e., net production
 gains)

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we express indirect losses relative to the direct damages
 or relative to yearly production when comparing impacts on the sector level.
 Note that, as the net change can be positive (production gains compared
 to baseline), we will use positive values to designate production gains,
 and negative values for losses.

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at simulations where indirect losses are more than five times
 the direct losses, (corresponding to the previously defined criterion),
 we find that such indirect losses only appear when the following are met:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rebuilding demand is considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rebuilding time is below a year (six and three month).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least equal to 0.95
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Overproduction pace is low enough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we observe that for all parameter sets where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is strictly below 1, EORA26 is the only MRIOT for which indirect losses
 exceed our criterion.
 In order to get comparable sets of parameters for all MRIOTs we remove:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where rebuilding time is three months and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least 0.97.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where rebuilding time is six months, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is at least 0.97 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

 is strictly greater than 90 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All sets where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 However, we find that more than 90% of the results fall between -40% and

 When considering

, we find a mix of positive and negative impacts across all MRIOTs and a
 much wider range of impacts (from 34% gains to -280% losses).
 The choice of the year of MRIOT data used (2000 or 2010) shows noticeable
 changes in the results for EUREGIO only in the simulations with rebuilding
 demand (where negatives extremes shift from -134% to -173%) and to a lesser
 extent, for the EORA26 MRIOT in both simulations with and without rebuilding
 demand (negative extremes shift from -40% to -45% without rebuilding demand,
 and from -250% to -280% with rebuilding demand).
 Results for EXIOBASE 3 deviate by less than 2% when changing the year,
 both when considering and not considering rebuilding demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When not considering rebuilding demand, the sensitivity to MRIOT choice
 does not change the results by more than 5%.
 Highest losses by MRIOT are -49% (EUREGIO 2000), -47% (EORA26 2010), and
 -40% (EXIOBASE3 2010), and average results are comprised between -28% (EORA
 2010) and -23% (EXIOBASE 3 both years).
 Minimum losses (no simulation results in gains in this scenario) differ
 by at most 3% (-13% for EORA 26 2010 and -10% for EXIOBASE3 both years).
 Conversely, when considering a rebuilding demand, results are more sensitive
 to the MRIOTs used.
 For instance, maximum gains for EUREGIO 2000 are 26%, while they amount
 to 34% for EXIOBASE 3 2010.
 75% quartile is respectively at 10%, -2% and -18% for EXIOBASE 3, EORA26
 and EUREGIO.
 Across both years, average results are respectively at -11%, -31% and -48%
 for EXIOBASE 3, EORA26 and EUREGIO and first quartile is -32% for EXIOBASE
 3, -47% for EORA26 and -67% for EUREGIO.

 In the simulations with rebuilding demand, outcomes are predominantly related
 to the pace of the rebuilding process.
 Notably, excessively rapid path (3 months) tends to lead to shortages,
 thereby driving the occurrence of important negative impacts.
 On the other hand, longest rebuilding paths (2 years) induce negative impacts
 from the prolonged reduced production and although less frequent, shortages
 can also manifest in this scenario.
 Conversely, rebuilding paths that do not result in shortages, or only lead
 to marginal shortages, generate production gains.
 These gains are driven by the demand generated through the rebuilding process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore we observe that, with rebuilding demand, the variation in results
 between different MRIOTs becomes more pronounced for sets of parameters
 which lead to important negative indirect impacts.
 This indicates a higher sensitivity to both the chosen parameters and the
 specific MRIOT employed, when considering rebuilding demand and making
 pessimistic assumptions on the parameters.
 This observation echoes withthe non-linear relationship between indirect
 losses and direct losses found by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "hallegatte13_model_role_inven_heter_asses"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: given a specific direct shock and a set of assumptions (e.g., parameters
 value) that give rise to indirect losses at a magnitude equal to or surpassing
 that of the direct losses, even minor adjustments in these assumptions
 lead to non-linear changes in indirect losses.

).
 In the absence of rebuilding demand, all sectors except the Construction
 sector, experience a decline in their yearly production ranging from less
 than 0.01% to 0.3%.Differences between MRIOT in average results are less than
 0.03%.
 We observe a greater difference for the Construction sector which declines
 at most by 0.03% for EORA26 and EUREGIO 3, and by 0.4% for EUREGIO.
 In line with our previous results, in the case without rebuilding demand,
 we do not observe much differences with different MRIOTs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, when we consider the rebuilding demand, the overall range of
 outcomes for each sector within each MRIOT significantly widens.
 For instance, the Manufacturing sector has maximum losses reaching 1.1%
 and maximum gains of 0.2%, as opposed to the narrower range of 0.2% and 0.05%
 observed without considering rebuilding.
 Moreover, disparities in outcomes between sectors across different MRIOTs
 become more pronounced.
 For instance, using the EUREGIO MRIOT, the Agriculture and Other sectors
 exhibit results ranging from -1.5% to -0.02%, whereas the range narrows to
 -0.26% to 0.06% when employing the EXIOBASE 3 MRIOT.
 On average, losses per sector are comparable to, or greater than, those
 obtained without accounting for rebuilding demand, with the notable (and
 expected) exception of the Construction sector, which registers an average
 gain of 0.6%, due to the fact that the rebuilding demand targets mostly
 this sector : this sector has to respond to an increase in demand to rebuild
 the infrastructures destroyed by the disaster.

 Moreover, lower values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 have minimal impact on the results, whereas higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 considerably increase result variability and shift them towards losses.
 Specifically, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is strictly below 0.90, the results range between -60% and +50% of the direct

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

, which denotes the pace of overproduction, it has limited influence in
 the recovery case.
 Lower values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

, indicating faster overproduction, lead to lower maximum losses, ranging
 from -50% of the direct damages for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=530$
\end_inset

 to -30% for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=90$
\end_inset

.
 In the rebuilding case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}$
\end_inset

 has little effect on the spread of results but shifts them towards gains
 as its value decreases.
 For example, gains do not exceed +10% of the direct damages for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=530$
\end_inset

, but increase up to +35% for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{\textrm{tau}}=90$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The duration of the recovery/rebuilding time also plays a role.
 In the recovery case, faster recovery times result in lower maximum losses,
 ranging from -50% of the direct damages for a two-year recovery time to
 -20% for a three-month recovery time.
 In the rebuilding case, the effect varies depending on the MRIOT considered.
 For EXIOBASE 3, shorter rebuilding times shift the results towards gains,
 with the range changing from -50% to +20% for the two-year scenario to
 -5% to +35% for the three-month scenario.
 Similar shifts towards gains can be observed for EORA26 and EUREGIO, but
 as the rebuilding time decreases, the spread of results increases, particularly
 for EORA26.

 When not considering a rebuilding demand, we find that most simulations

 In rare instances where indirect impacts result in losses, they represent
 less than -0.5% of the direct damages.
\end_layout

In simulations with rebuilding demand, most outcomes are also gains, and
 in this case tend to be significantly higher than in the recovery case.
 For instance, these gains (aggregated over all sectors) reach up to +0.03%

 of yearly production in the Rest Of the World (
\family typewriter

Although less simulations lead to losses for not directly affected regions
 than for Germany, there are still several simulations which result in significa

 For instance in the

 Note here, that 
\family typewriter

 When comparing to the actual size of the

 For France, highest indirect impacts are less than -0.3% of yearly production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we look at the variation of results across the different MRIOTs.
 Contrary to Germany, there is a higher variability of results between MRIOTs
 when not considering rebuilding demand.
 For instance, simulation with EORA26 lead to gains in china that are ten
 times higher in average than with EUREGIO or EXIOBASE 3.
 Noticeably, simulations with EUREGIO show slightly higher gains in France
 and slightly lower gains in USA and 
\family typewriter

\family default
compared to EORA26 and EXIOBASE 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering rebuilding demand, results spread is lowest for EXIOBASE
 3 and highest for EORA26 when considering rebuilding demand in all regions,
 similar to Germany.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that when using the EXIOBASE3 MRIOT, losses are not observed
 in the rebuilding case except for very rare cases in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analyzing the sector-level impacts, the majority of the gains are driven
 by the Manufacturing sector.
 On the other hand, no significant patterns emerge in terms of losses, except
 that the Construction and Other sectors exhibit noticeably fewer losses

In this paper we carry out an in-depth sensitivity analysis of ARIO, a model
 which has often been used in the literature to assess the indirect economic
 impact of disasters, and whose mechanisms have been used as a foundation
 by numerous other models (Colon et al., 2019; Koks and Thissen, 2016; Otto
 et al., 2017; Shughrue and Seto, 2018).
 We find that the choice of taking into account or not the demand for reconstruc
tion after a disaster especially leads to large differences in the results.

\begin_layout Standard
When taking into account this demand, i.e.
 if we suppose that the recovery can only come when some economic sectors
 produce more to rebuild what was destroyed by the disaster, the economic
 impact of the disaster can be positive (i.e.
 economic gains).
 The extra demand can indeed act as a stimulus for the economy (Hallegatte,
 2014).
 It can also be largely negative, as the extra demand may conversely create
 shortages harming the whole economy.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we do not take into account this demand, i.e.
 if we suppose that the recovery occurs exogenously without any demand to
 rebuild damaged infrastructures, then the economic impact is always moderately
 negative.
 In our simulations, when taking into account rebuilding demand, total productio
n change ranges from about +40% (i.e.
 gains) to -250% (i.e.
 losses) of the direct losses.
 When we do not take into account this demand, total production change ranges
 only from -50% to -10% of the direct losses.

\begin_layout Standard
Both hypotheses can be found in the literature, in different papers (e.g.,
 Wang et al.
 (2020) and Koks et al.
 (2014)).
 Both choices represent extreme cases, as it may be expected that reconstruction
 will lead to at least some demand to the construction sector (see for instance
 the empirical work by Hsiang (2010)).
 It may also be expected that the need for rebuilding may not be strictly
 equivalent to the direct damages, as some destroyed elements may not be
 reconstructed or new types of infrastructures may be built instead.
 Our results highlight that a better description of rebuilding may be essential
 to improve the reliability of natural disaster economic costs models.
 We can note, however, that some disasters, which lead to business interruptions
 while not destroying capital, may be studied with models such as ARIO without
 having to solve this issue.
 They indeed lead to a zero rebuilding demand.
 This is for instance the case of droughts, or of some power blackouts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also note that, when we do not take into account rebuilding demand,
 the shape of the exogenous recovery over time does only influence marginally
 the results.
 When not taking onto account this demand, the specificity of the shape
 of the recovery appears to be only a secondary concern.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When taking into account the rebuilding demand, the economic data used as
 input to the model appears to play an important role in the simulation
 results.
 Using EXIOBASE 3 as the input-output table leads to indirect impacts lower
 in average than using EUREGIO and EORA26.
 EUREGIO and EORA26 also show more variability in the results, tied with
 the presence of important negative outcomes.
 It is difficult to determine a priori which database is more suited to
 the economic analysis of a disaster, and, here again, different choices
 have been made in different papers in the literature.
 Our results highlight the importance of employing and comparing the outcomes
 of multiple IO tables in such studies.

In this paper we conducted an analysis of the responses of the ARIO model
 to the use of different MRIOTs, a wide range of values for its main parameters,
 and two shock recovery mecanisms.
 Globally, we found the responses to be very sensitive to those choices,
 with simulations leading to indirect gains of up to 40% of the direct losses
 and other to indirect losses of more than 250% of the direct losses.
 Our findings highlight the importance of employing and comparing multiple
 MRIOTs, exploring different parameter configurations, and assessing various
 recovery scenarios when using models such as ARIO.
 Furthermore, transparent justifications for these choices are imperative,
 as they can alter the qualitative nature of results.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In particular, we found that whether a rebuilding demand is considered or
 not, and how long it takes to answer this demand, appears to be a main
 factor in possible outcomes.
 For instance, if the model is set to rebuild 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too fast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 3 months), indirect impacts seem extremely large (higher than 500% of the
 initial direct damages).
 This result supports the importance of careful ressources allocation after
 a disaster in order to avoid supply chains struggle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The use of different MRIOTs showed important variation in results (when
 considering a rebuilding demand).
 Using EXIOBASE 3 leads to indirect impacts lower in average than EUREGIO
 and EORA26.
 EUREGIO and EORA26 also show more variability in the results, tied with
 the presence of important negative outcomes.

Finally, changes in parameters values also largely have more influence

the results expecially when 
\change_deleted 1286759212 1694193581
 
\change_unchanged
rebuilding demand is taken into account.
 Simulations show high sensitivity to parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and rebuilding duration in this case.
 Rebuilding durations that are too short especially lead to large indirect
 impacts : as rebuilding demand per step is high in this case, intermediate
 demand is often 
\change_deleted 1286759212 1694193581
 
\change_unchanged
rationed which quickly results in shortages.
 High 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 values are also associated with important shortages and indirect impact
 as such values effectively reduce the buffering effect of inventories.
 We found that values higher than 0.97 lead to results exceeding 500% of
 the direct damages when rebuilding demand is considered while this is not
 the case when no rebuilding demand is considered, as the rationing is less
 pronounced in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These elements show that results are heavily dependent on assumptions about
 rebuilding and the rigidity of constraints on the actors.
 This aligns with existing studies that have shown both positive and negative
 indirect impacts following a shock.
 We observe that the ARIO model can both lead to negative and positive impacts
 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

creative destruction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hypothesis).
 While this provides versatility in representing economic dynamics, it highlight
s the importance of carefully exploring the range of possible outcomes and
 avoid limiting studies to one set of parameters values, scenario and IO
 table or MRIOT.
 In particular, we suggest that the ARIO model is best used when examining
 different recovery story-lines from a shock.
 For instance, comparing results obtained assuming an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optimal recovery path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

struggling recovery path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could offer valuable insights at local and global levels, providing both
 optimistic and pessimistic estimates of aggregated losses from extreme
 events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our analysis did not include parameters related to inventories, such as
 size and resupply time and sectoral (or even regional) heterogeneity, due
 to the complexity it would introduce, especially on a per-sector and per-MRIOT
 basis.
 Future studies could focus on this aspect to account for dissimilarities
 across different sectors or regions, especially on inventories management.
 Further research steps could also involve analyzing the effects of other
 events using our methodology and conducting an inter-comparison with other
 models to enhance the robustness and consistency of our findings.
 Recent events such as the COVID19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine also
 show how trade relations can changes quickly and how supply chains are
 put in difficulty

 This raise the importance of looking at deeper changes in MRIOTs and how
 it can influence vulnerability to indirect economics impacts.

\begin_layout Standard
The economy is modelled as a set of economic sectors and a set of regions.
 In the following, we call an industry a specific (sector, region) couple.
 Each economic sector produces its generic product and draws inputs from
 an inventory.
 Each industry answers to a total demand consisting of a final demand (household
 consumption, public spending and private investments) coming from all regions
 (i.e.
 both local demand and exports), intermediate demand (inventory resupply).
 An initial equilibrium state of the economy is built based on multi-regional
 input-output tables (MRIOT).
 Apart from parameters specific to the MRIOT region-sector typology, BoARIO
 handles any MRIOT in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple kinds of shocks can be implemented:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the production capacity directly (one or multiple industries are arbitrarily
 forced to produce less)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the productive capital (one or multiple industries arbitrarily lose some
 part of their factors of production and are thus forced to both produce
 less and to build back their capital stock).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the households (households of affected regions lose some part of their
 goods and seek to get them back).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model then describes how exogenous shocks propagates across the economy
 at each time step (a day in the present study
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our implementation actually allows for any time granularity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

): the imbalance between production and demand is resolved by a proportional
 rationing scheme, which then leads some industries and households to not
 receive the totality of their orders.
 Industries can buffer these unfilled orders with their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inventories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of input and increase or shift their resupply demand.
 Currently, households simply register the loss as final consumption not
 met and do not postpone their demand.
 During the simulation, industries adjust their production and orders based
 on both demand and their inventories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct economic impact consists in the valuation of the initial exogenous
 shock, while total economic impact includes also indirect costs consequent
 to the propagation.
 Total economic impact can be measured in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Final demand not met, i.e.
 goods that households could not buy due to rationing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Relative production change, i.e.
 diminished or increased production of industries relative to their initial
 production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we focus on the second measure.

 Initial values for intermediate orders

\begin_inset Formula $Y(t=0)$
\end_inset

 and production 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t=0)$
\end_inset

 are derived from the MRIOT.
 Inventories 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(t)$
\end_inset

 are stocks of inputs an industry can draw into (see below for a detailed
 description of inventories) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(t=0)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In ARIO, economic sectors do not use inputs from other sectors directly,
 but draw inputs from inventories, that can then be re-supplied with intermediat
e orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

.
 An industry's inventory is a vector that specifies how much of each product
 this industry has in stock.
 Each sector needs intermediate inputs in proportions given by the MRIOT
 at the initial state.
 Industries draw inputs from their inventories to try to produce at the
 optimal production level 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 However, these inventories cannot be emptied: actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 can thus be set lower than optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

 to be sure that inventories are above a certain threshold (see Production
 for more details).
 Inventories have been implemented into ARIO to give a more realistic account
 of supply chain shocks, which can be mitigated by input stocks.
 The current state of an inventory for a definite input is expressed as
 the number of time steps a sector can produce with said input at current
 production level.

Direct shocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct shocks are exogenous and can occur at any time step t.
 Conceptually, these shocks are the direct economic consequences of the
 events we are modelling.
 They can either be (i) direct production capacity losses or (ii) capital
 destruction.
 Capital is the only factor of production, so that in any industry 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 capital destruction turns into 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 production loss, as long as capital is not restored.
 There are two ways to model capital rebuilding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Recovery Productive capital recovers from a purely exogenous function and
 at no cost for the economic agents: capital stock in a directly impacted
 industry goes back to its original level over time, following a chosen
 recovery curve, without any need for production sparing for rebuilding.
 This scenario can model the situation where capital is not actually destroyed
 but less available for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Rebuilding Productive capital is recovered through an endogenous rebuilding
 demand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 which consists of new orders directed to sectors that usually provide capital
 stock: construction, transport equipment, manufacturing, etc.
 This additional demand leads to a reduction of actual production being
 allocated
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a reduction also happens in the Recovery case but to a lesser extent,
 as it only comes from the production reduction caused by the event
\end_layout

 or intermediate orders

\begin_layout Standard
The production module computes actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 for each industry at the current time step with the following process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It computes production capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

, which is production in the initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t=0)$
\end_inset

 less production capacity reduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It defines optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

 as the minimum between production capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Cap}}(t)$
\end_inset

 and total demand 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)+Y(t)+\Gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 : the model is demand-driven, and industries cannot produce more than total
 demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, the actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 is computed from 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

, taking into account inventories constraints.
 More precisely, an industry can produce 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 only if it has more than a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 of the required inputs of each type to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\textrm{input}}$
\end_inset

 time steps in a row, in order to model producers' or cautious anticipatory
 behavior.
 In order to satisfy this constraint, if the inventory for an input is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 below the aforementioned threshold, actual production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{a}}(t)$
\end_inset

 is reduced by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 compared to optimal production 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

 This constraint must be satisfied for each type of input (i.e.
 sectors) involved.

 Total demand consists of final demand

\begin_layout Itemize
Final demand

 Currently, it stays fixed during the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intermediate orders 
\begin_inset Formula $O(t)$
\end_inset

 are decided based on inventories and consists of two parts: the first part
 is the amount of inputs used to produce during the current step, while
 the second is a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{inv}}}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining gap with inventory goal.
 Inventory goals are defined as the inventories needed to produce at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\textrm{Opt}}(t)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case capital rebuilding has been set as endogenous, only a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}}}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining rebuilding demand is ordered at each step, so that rebuilding
 is not instantaneous but takes a characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\textrm{rebuild}}$

 Rebuilding demand is used to build back capital stocks and thus restores
 production capacities to their pre-shock levels.
 If capital rebuilding is exogenous, there is no rebuilding demand.

 when they cannot meet total demand.
 It is a gradual process: when needed, the overproduction factor

 can switch from a base value

 The evolution of also depends on a scarcity index, defined as unmet demand
 divided by total demand: it is faster the higher the scarcity index is.
 In the current state of development of BoARIO, overproduction comes at

 As shortages start to appear, demand is still distributed among suppliers

 However, as unmet demand grows, suppliers that have not been affected by
 direct impacts (on capital or production) can overproduce and catch demand
 from new buyers.
 Buyers will then marginally shift their orders to producers that can overproduc

When the industry does not have to answer a rebuilding demand, or in the
 recovery case, and no shortage happens (either because the shock is too
 small or the parameters not too constraining).
 The model suffers a loss of production for the duration of the event and
 then slowly regains its production output via the recovery as well as the
 overproduction mechanism.
 A small overshoot to refill possible remaining gaps in inventories can
 be seen before initial equilibrium is found again.

If a shortage happens, it slows down the return of production level to its
 initial amount, possibly extending the recovery period.
 It may also slightly increase the overshoot in production as inventory
 gaps are increased by the longer recovery.

c)
\end_layout

\end_inset

When the industry answers a rebuilding demand, but no shortage happens,
 production rises more sharply due to the increased scarcity created by
 the rebuilding demand.
 Production also continues to increase as long as total demand is not met,
 and starts decreasing when it is met and remaining rebuilding demand and
 inventory gaps are answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

d)
\end_layout

\end_inset

If a shortage happens, production reduces to match its inventories.
 As long as total demand remains higher than production for the input(s)
 responsible for the shortage, the inventory gap continues to increase and
 production to decrease.
 This stops when production is low enough and received orders are high enough
 so that the gap starts decreasing.
 Production then increases back as in the last phase of c), but sharply
 due to the increased orders to refill inventories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actual responses can of course be more complex, as interrelations between
 industries create feedbacks.
 As such, shortages can occur earlier or later, at several different times,
 and decrease production to a greater extent.
